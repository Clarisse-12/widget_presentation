          Modal BottomSheet widget

    
    A bottom sheet is a window that slides up from the bottom edge of the screen. It is used to reveal additional content and options to users. If required, users can show and dismiss the BottomSheet widget.
    This widget is available for the Android platform only and can be created only through code. The following Gradle Entry needs to be made in order to access the BottomSheet widget.

    Following are the key use cases of Bottom Sheet widget:
    To provide a visually richer options menu. For example: when we want to share an image through an application, a BottomSheet widget can be used to show the various applications that can be used for sharing.
    To display more data or information. For example: In a map widget, when we click on a pin, you can use a BottomSheet widget to display more information about the location.
    Can be used instead of dialog boxes. For example: while exiting an app, a BottomSheet can be used to ask for confirmation.
